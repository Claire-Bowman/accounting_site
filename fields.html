        <h1>Managerial Accounting</h1>
        <p>Managerial accounting focuses on providing financial and operational information to internal stakeholders, enabling effective decision-making, planning, and control. It involves budgeting, performance evaluation, cost management, and financial analysis. Unlike financial accounting, it is forward-looking and tailored to meet the specific needs of management within an organization.</p>
    
        <h1>Financial Accounting</h1>
        <p>Financial accounting involves recording, summarizing, and reporting an organizationâ€™s financial transactions through standardized statements like the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. It aims to provide accurate financial information to external stakeholders, such as investors and regulators, ensuring transparency and compliance with accounting standards.</p>
    
        <h1>Forensic Accounting</h1>
        <p>Forensic accounting involves investigating financial records to detect fraud, embezzlement, and other financial discrepancies. It combines accounting, auditing, and investigative skills to analyze complex financial data, often for legal cases. Forensic accountants provide expert testimony in court, supporting legal actions and helping to resolve financial disputes.</p>

        <h1>Auditing</h1>
        <p>Auditing involves the systematic examination of an organization's financial statements and records to ensure accuracy, compliance, and reliability. It includes evaluating internal controls, detecting errors or fraud, and providing an independent opinion. Auditors help maintain transparency, build stakeholder trust, and support sound financial practices within organizations.</p>
